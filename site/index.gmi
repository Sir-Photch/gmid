# gmid

> A Gemini server

## Features

* sandboxed by default on OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Linux
* able to reload the configuration on-the-fly without loosing connections
* punycode and IRI support
* reverse proxying
* CGI and FastCGI support
* virtual hosts and per-location rules
* low memory footprint
* event-based asynchronous I/O model

gmid also bundles a small gemini client called ‘gg’ (gemini get), a stripped-down server for quick testing called ‘gemexp’ and a titan implementation.

## Install

Some distros provide a package — thanks to the maintainers!

=> REPOLOGY	Repology: packaging status for gmid

Otherwise, compile it from source: it’s easy and takes less than a minute on a raspberry pi 3

=> GITHUB/releases/download/VERS/gmid-VERS.tar.gz	gmid-VERS.tar.gz

=> https://git.omarpolo.com/?action=summary&path=gmid.git git repository
=> https://codeberg.org/op/gmid/		Codeberg mirror
=> GITHUB					GitHub mirror

The dependencies are:

* libevent
* OpenSSL/LibreSSL
* yacc or GNU bison

Once all the dependencies are installed, building is as easy as:

```Example of how to compile from source
$ curl -LO GITHUB/releases/download/VERS/gmid-VERS.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf gmid-VERS.tar.gz
$ cd gmid-VERS
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install # eventually
```

A SHA256 file is available.  However, that only checks for accidental corruption: you can use signify (SHA256.sig and the public key gmid-CURV.pub).  The signify public key for the next release ‘gmid-NEXTV.pub’ is also included.

=> GITHUB/releases/download/VERS/SHA256		SHA256
=> GITHUB/releases/download/VERS/SHA256.sig	SHA256.sig

To verify the signatures with signify(1)

```Example of how to verify the signature with signify
% signify -C -p gmid-1.8.pub -x SHA256.sig
Signature Verified
gmid-VERS.tar.gz: OK
gmid-CURV.pub: OK
gmid-NEXTV.pub: OK
```
