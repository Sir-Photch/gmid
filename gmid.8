.Nm gmid
.Nd simple and secure Gemini server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op Fl fhnVv
.Op Fl c Ar config
.Op Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple and minimal gemini server that can serve static files,
talk to FastCGI applications and act as a gemini reverse proxy.
It can run without a configuration file with a limited set of features
available.
.Pp
.Nm
rereads the configuration file when it receives
.Dv SIGHUP .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 14m
.It Fl c Ar config
Specifies the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/gmid.conf .
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the config file if present.
.It Fl f
Stays and logs on the foreground.
.It Fl h , Fl -help
Print the usage and exit.
.It Fl n
Check that the configuration is valid, but don't start the server.
If specified two or more time, dump the configuration in addition to
verify it.
.It Fl P Ar pidfile
Write daemon's pid to the given location.
.Ar pidfile
will also act as lock: if another process is holding a lock on that
file,
.Nm
will refuse to start.
.It Fl V , Fl -version
Print the version and exit.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Multiple
.Fl v
options increase the verbosity.
.El
.Sh LOGGING
Messages and requests are logged by
.Xr syslog 3
using the
.Dv DAEMON
facility or printed on
.Em stderr .
.Pp
Requests are logged with the
.Dv NOTICE
severity.
Each request log entry has the following fields, separated by
whitespace:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Client IP address and the source port number, separated by a colon
.It
.Sy GET
keyword
.It
Request URL
.It
Response status
.It
Response meta
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To run
.Nm
a configuration file and a X.509 certificate must be provided.
A self-signed certificate, which are commonly used in the Geminispace,
can be generated using for e.g.\&
.Xr openssl 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# openssl req \-x509 \-newkey rsa:4096 \-nodes \e
	\-keyout /etc/ssl/private/example.com.key \e
	\-out /etc/ssl/example.com.pem \e
	\-days 365 \-subj "/CN=example.com"
# chmod 600 /etc/ssl/example.com.crt
# chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/example.com.key
.Ed
.Pp
Then
.Nm
can be started with
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# gmid -c /etc/gmid.conf
.Ed

.Sh CAVEATS
.Bl -bullet
.It
All the root directories are opened during the daemon startup; if a
root directory is deleted and then re-created,
.Nm
won't be able to serve files inside that directory until a restart.
This restriction only applies to the root directories and not their
content.
.It
a %2F sequence is indistinguishable from a literal slash: this is not
RFC3986-compliant.
.It
a %00 sequence is treated as invalid character and thus rejected.
